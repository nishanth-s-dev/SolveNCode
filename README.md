# ðŸ”¥ SolveNCode ðŸ”¥

This is my personal repository where I solve coding problems daily using Python3. The goal is to push myself to solve at least one problem every day and track my progress.

## Folder Structure

Each day has its own folder:

```
SolveNCode/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ day_001/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ problem_name.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ another_problem.py
â”œâ”€â”€ day_002/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ problem_name.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ another_problem.py
â”œâ”€â”€ day_003/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ problem_name.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ another_problem.py
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

- Folders are named `day_xxx` for easy tracking.
- Files within each folder correspond to individual problems for that day.

## Purpose

- Practice problem-solving daily.
- Track progress over time.

## Notes

- Everything is solved in Python 3.
- This repo is private for personal use only.
